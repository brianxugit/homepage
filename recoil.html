        <h1>Recoil Game</h1>
    </div>
    <p>An unused prototype I made during the development of Data Stream. The
        prototype I presented to the team was developed from the idea of using sound to cause recoil and push
        the player around. The concept was rejected due to a similar game produced by a group the prior year with a similar
        recoil concept. I returned to the prototype during a break in development as an excercise
        in animation, 2D shaders, and rendering. The firearm version I made was to experiment with other simpler ideas.
