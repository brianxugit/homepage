        <h1>Recoil Game</h1>
    </div>
    <p>An unused prototype I made during the development of Data Stream. The
        prototype I presented to the team was developed from the idea of using sound to cause recoil and push
        the player around. The concept was rejected due to another group using a gun recoil idea the year prior.
        I returned to the prototype during a break in development as an excercise
        in animation, shaders, and 2D rendering. I stepped back from the sound idea and designed a firearm instead
        for simplicity.

    <p>Throw a projectile which can be shot. Recoil can be reduced while grounded by crouching.
        The projectile explodes after a timer which produces a small knockback.
        Multiple explosions will accumulate; with the freeze mechanic, this can create a large push.
