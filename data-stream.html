    <p>A game development project completed in fall 2022, developed using Unity. A 2D platformer
        where we challenged ourselves to innovate on 2D platformer mechanics. I worked closely with
        our project lead and we bounced many ideas off each other to design our game's core gameplay. 
        My primary contribution was in designing and implementing these gameplay mechanics as well as
        the underlying systems of interaction. I produced the menu music as well as many unused concept
        artworks throughout the course of the project.
